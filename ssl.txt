Enable SSL for Streamlit.

To enable SSL for a Streamlit dashboard, you will need an SSL certificate for your domain.
You can obtain an SSL certificate from a trusted certificate authority such as L
et's Encrypt or purchase one from a third-party provider.

Once you have an SSL certificate, you can enable SSL in Streamlit by following these steps:
Install the pyopenssl package using pip: pip install pyopenssl.
Generate a self-signed SSL certificate using OpenSSL. You can use the following command to generate a self-signed SSL certificate:

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout key.pem -days 365
This command will generate an SSL certificate (cert.pem) and a private key (key.pem) that are valid for 365 days.

In your Streamlit app, add the following code at the top of your script:

import streamlit as st
import ssl

if st._is_running_with_streamlit:
    # SSL certificate configuration
    ctx = ssl.create_default_context()
    ctx.load_cert_chain("cert.pem", "key.pem")
This code creates an SSL context and loads the SSL certificate and private key generated in step 2.

Run your Streamlit app using the --server.enableHttps option:
streamlit run your_app.py --server.enableHttps --server.sslCertificate cert.pem --server.sslKey key.pem


This command starts the Streamlit server with HTTPS enabled and specifies the SSL certificate and private key files to use.
Note: If you are using a self-signed SSL certificate, your browser may warn you that the connection is not secure. To avoid this warning, you can add the SSL certificate to your browserâ€™s list of trusted certificates.
